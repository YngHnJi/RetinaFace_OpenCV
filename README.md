## Introduction

This is a repository to run Retinaface model with OpenCV library in C++

A lots of code lines come from the link [here](https://github.com/linghu8812/tensorrt_inference/tree/master/RetinaFace) for onnx model converting and Retinaface model inference.

## Environments

- This code developed in VisualStudio 2019 with OpenCV(ver 4.5.1)
- only CPU inference supported, GPU acceleration not supported.
- Due to the property of ONNX format, fixed size input required in order to run model
